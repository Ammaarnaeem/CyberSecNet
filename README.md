## "CyberSecNet" Cyber Attack Classification and Clustering using different Machine learning Algorithms
CyberSecNet is a project aimed at analyzing and classifying cyber attacks using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of network traffic data to identify various types of cyber attacks and cluster them based on their characteristics.

Features and Functionality
Data Exploration: The project provides functionality to explore the dataset and understand the characteristics and distributions of different features.

Data Preprocessing: It performs data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling to prepare the data for classification.

Feature Selection: The project employs correlation analysis to identify the most relevant features for classification, improving the accuracy and efficiency of the models.

Classification Algorithms: Three classification algorithms, namely Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), are implemented to classify cyber attacks based on the selected features.

Clustering: The project also includes clustering using the k-Means algorithm to group similar attacks together. The results are visualized using scatter plots to provide insights into the patterns and relationships within the data.

Usage
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
Open the notebook file and follow the step-by-step instructions to explore, preprocess, classify, and cluster the cyber attack dataset.
Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing network traffic attributes, including various types of cyber attacks. The dataset is provided in the Dataset.txt file, and additional information about attack types can be found in the Attack_types.txt file.
